# Birds-Nest-Monitoring-Raspberry-Pi
This code is all about the self-made nest monitoring system on Raspberry Pi

All the accessories are raw materials taken from home. The project is about monitoring the behaviour of diiferent birds throughout the day. We are actually fetching the time and date of the incoming bird enjoying our feed. The idea is about doing a research on birds connected to Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.

We're open to ideas for the improvement in the current research. Suggestions & advices are welcomed.
